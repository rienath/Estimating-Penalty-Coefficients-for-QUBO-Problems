## Run Time and Run Length Distributions
- Difference
- Why second is better
- Struggles
- Final 
- Have to fix num_reads to 1 in tabu to make sure we are measuring the time of 1 solution
- Num_restarts has to be 1 (there is a reference in code). However, in normal runs a default value of 1000000 is used

## Jupyter Notebooks
* Works well with coded python module as it looks clean
