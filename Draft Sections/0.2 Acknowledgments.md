Although all the work that follows has been solely done by myself, I owe it to the great people that have been surrounding me. And I am privileged enough that if I list all of them, the focus of this work will shift to social sciences. That is why I want briefly thank only a few:
- My mother who has greatly supported me ever since I started university.
- My dad who has how to do and love the mathematics.
- Professor John McCall, who has helped me to see the beauty of science and guided me through the vastness of this project.

I also  express my gratitude to Robert Gordon University for developing my critical thinking - an irreplaceable tool that will help me throughout my professional life.
