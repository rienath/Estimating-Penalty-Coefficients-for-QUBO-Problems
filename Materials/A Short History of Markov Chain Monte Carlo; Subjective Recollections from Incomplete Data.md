## Description
Connects Metropolis algorithm to Simulated Annealing.

'The number of iterations of the Metropolis algorithm used in the paper seems to be limited: 16 steps for burn-in and 48 to 64 subsequent iterations, which required four to five hours on the Los Alamos computer. 

An interesting variation is the Simulated Annealing algorithm, developed by Kirkpatrick, Gelatt and Vecchi (1983), who connected optimization with annealing, the cooling of a metal. Their variation is to allow the temperature T in (1) to change as the algorithm runs, according to a “cooling schedule,” and the Simulated Annealing algorithm can be shown to find the global maximum with probability 1, although the analysis is quite complex due to the fact that, with varying T, the algorithm is no longer a time-homogeneous Markov chain.''
