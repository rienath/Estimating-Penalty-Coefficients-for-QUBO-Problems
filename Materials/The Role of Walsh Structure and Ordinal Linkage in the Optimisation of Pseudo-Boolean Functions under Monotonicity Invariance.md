## Description
PhD thesis of Lee Christie. This work is very well written, and has the best explanation of Walsh decomposition encountered so far. 

```
The non-zero Walsh coefficients indicates parts of the structure which are present [71]. A non-zero Walsh coefficient, on a clique of more than o ne variables, represents an interaction between the variables in the function. For example, the term alpha{3,8} represents the bivariate interaction between variables X3 and X8. If there is no bivariate interaction between these variables, the coefficient is zero.
