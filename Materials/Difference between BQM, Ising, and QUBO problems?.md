## Description
Explains the difference between the 3. Since in QUBO the values are binary, {0, 1}, we can easily express the problem in quadratic (and therefore in a special matrix) form. As 0^2 = 0 and 1^2 = 1. This is not the case with Ising as spins are {-1, 1}. 

They are different, but related (isomorphic) and can be used in different problems depending on what is needed. For example, if we have a problem with people from 2 groups, we can easily check if they are from the same group by x1\*x2 > 0 same group, x1\*x2 < 0 different groups with Ising model.
