## Description
The run length distribution is the part that interests us. 

_"The RLD shows, for each algorithm, the cumulative percentage of successful runs that terminated within a certain number of function evaluations"_

- We need to test it on a single problem rather than a cluster of different ones
- We record how many steps it took for algorithm to finish
* And where it has finished (energy)
* Then we plot the cumulative number of successful problems (percentage) agains the number of steps made
