## Description
Proposes a new technique that can be used to translate inequalities into quantum annealer Chimera graph. Most likely, this is going to be done by some library in the project, so the results are only relatively relevant. But there are few good citations.

`Having a large gap is important because it enables using smaller _M_ values, making the resulting optimization problem more stable numerically and thereby increasing the accuracy of the solution.`

The conclusion:
`The experimental analysis shows that solving the resulting QUBO problem with a classical solver or with D-Wave plus classical postprocessing is accurate, but solutions with a purely quantum solver lack sufficient accuracy`

They say that higher penalty coefficients make the model unstable
