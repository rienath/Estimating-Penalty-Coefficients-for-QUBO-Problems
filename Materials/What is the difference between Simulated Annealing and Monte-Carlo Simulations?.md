## Description
Explains the difference. Good citation:

'MCMC aims to generate samples that respect and underlying distribution, while SA aims to find the maximum of a function...
The similarity is that in both cases you want to visit the parts of the function that have the high values with higher frequency, but in SA you actually want to converge and in a way "get stuck" in a peak, while with MCMC you want sometimes to sample the other parts of the function too as you aim to visit every part of the function with a frequency proportional to the value. Algorithmicaly this is achieved in SA with the "annealing schedule" which shrinks the movement radius of the random walk over time in order to zero in a local maxima.'
