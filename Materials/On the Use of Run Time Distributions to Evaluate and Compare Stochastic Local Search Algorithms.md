## Description
Most importantly, explains what a run time distribution (RTD) is. 

_"Run time distributions or time-to-target plots display on the ordinate axis the probability that an algorithm will find a solution at least as good as a given target value within a given running time"_

We could use results obtained by Verma and Lewis penalty approach as target, and then make a "RTD" for the new algorithm.
